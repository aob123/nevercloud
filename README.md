# Nevercloud

Welcome to neverlcoud.

This is just a site/blog/info whatever you want to call it about my explorations
in to the world of de-clouding my life!

## Declouding?

I'm not sure if it's a real term but it made sense to me, and it is was it says: removing clouds from your life!

## Why?

Over the years i've grown more aware of the importance of privacy and also the fact that a lot of our data is 
harvested and monetised. Do i make anyh money off of my own data? It appears not. And i don't remember anyone,
ever, in a human and understandable way explaining that this is the case.

## How?

At the moment i've started out with my own server, where i host this site and use jellyfin for movies and tv-shows.
I realise i'm not even close to being declouded, but slowly and surely i'll get there!

## Disclaimer

I realise not all cloud services are evil, but i want to own as much of my own data as possible, so for the sake of
some cofort and ease and to counter total isolation i will have to compromise with using some cloud services, as 
it seems at the moment.
